# Steam Auto Confirm/Accept

This script uses the node Steam modules created by Alexander Corn aka. [DoctorMcKay](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay), and it can:
	-automatically confirm all market listings and accepted trade offers
	-accept all trades where the user doesn't loose items
	-put the user online, playing a specified game for card farming
